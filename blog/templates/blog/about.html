                The motivation behind this project was mass fake news and an abundance of sensationalism in traditional news sources, as well as social media. We realized that large networks with the ability spread news to millions of people 
                with just the click of a button have an unbalanced share of power in editing the knowledge of the collective. By creating News Simplified, a program that pits different news sources against each other, we essentially place 
                them all in check with each other. This would be safer for society as it provides clearer, less emotionally driven, facts to the general public. Differences in opinion will be settled with facts and clear ideas of opposing 
                perspectives rather than a cloud of ignorance.
