We realized that large networks with the ability spread news to millions of people with just the click of a button have an unbalanced share of power in editing the knowledge of the collective. By creating News Simplified, a program that pits different news sources against each other, we essentially place them all in check with each other. This would be safer for society as it provides clearer, less emotionally driven, facts to the general public. Differences in opinion will be settled with facts and clear ideas of opposing perspectives rather than a cloud of ignorance. Right now, our program is proficient in finding facts and opinions, sensationalism and the key points of articles. These accomplishments are the first requirements for News Simplified. The second requirement, ease of use, is currently being worked on. There is a long wait time for processing of articles, but pre-processed articles as well as leaner coding should bring down the processing time and ease of use. Other than this, the output of the program is easy to understand and should allow for most of the second requirement to be accomplished. Finally, our pre-processing of articles has not been implemented.</textarea>
